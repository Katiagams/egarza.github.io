### Short Bio
I am Medical Doctor and a Neuroscience researcher with a position as *Researcher in Medical Sciences* at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City, Mexico. I also have a position as a *Visiting Senior Researcher* at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. 

I'm a promoter and user of *Open Science* and *Open Access* initiatives.

### Research Interests
My research focuses on finding neuroimaging biomarkers in neuropsychiatric conditions that could be used for diagnosis or treatment evaluation. Currently my main line of research has been in *Substance Addiction* and *Connectomics*, collaborating closely with PI Mallar Chakravarty at the [CoBrA Lab](http://cobralab.ca).


In parallel, I'm interested in the effects of music in chronic pain conditions, so-called *Music-Induced Analgesia*. For this I collaborate with PI Peter Vuust at the [Center for Music in the Brain](http://musicinthebrain.au.dk/).
